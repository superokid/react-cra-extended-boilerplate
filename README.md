Boilerplate react extended from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with personal preference library and tooling.

## Motivation

I set up react boilerplate almost the same way for every CRA project, so instead of doing it repetitively, this is the reason this repo created. In the future, this repo choose an opinionated library, for example, react-router, styled-components, redux, etc
